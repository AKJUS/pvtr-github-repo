# Privateer Plugin for GitHub Repositories

This plugin is currently under construction, intended to provide evaluations for a GitHub Repository based on the Open Source Project Security Baseline control catalog.

A Dockerfile is provided to build the plugin alongside Privateer as a container image. The plugin is intended to be run as a container image, and will require a GitHub Personal Access Token to be provided as an environment variable.

# Privateer Plugin for GitHub Repositories

This plugin is designed to test a GitHub repository using automated assessments compatible with the [Simplified Compliance Infrastructure](https://github.com/revanite-io/sci) Layer 4 data types.

## Work in Progress

Assessment development is currently addressing the [Open Source Project Security Baseline v2025.02.25](https://baseline.openssf.org).

As possible, the goal is to work on the OSPS Baseline maturity levels from the lowest to highest.
